# ChallengeMe
## Lehigh Valley Hackathon 2024
## By Leo Chen, Tolga Daim, and Sean Pandaleon

### Description
ChallengeMe is a student-focused app designed to boost motivation and consistency through friendly competition. Users can join or create challenges related to job applications, financial budgeting, fitness, and more.

### Impact
- **Enhanced Accountability**: By participating in challenges, users feel a sense of responsibility towards their goals, leading to increased commitment and follow-through.
- **Community Engagement**: ChallengeMe fosters a supportive community where users can motivate each other, share experiences, and celebrate achievements, creating a positive feedback loop.
- **Goal Achievement**: The gamification of personal and academic challenges helps users stay focused on their objectives, resulting in improved performance in job applications, budgeting, fitness, and other areas of life.

With ChallengeMe, students not only strive for personal success but also contribute to a thriving community of motivated individuals.

### Inspiration
ChallengeMe was inspired by the need for a supportive platform where students can not only compete but also motivate each other to reach their goals. We wanted to create a space that fosters personal growth through community engagement and friendly competition.

### What it does
ChallengeMe allows users to create and participate in challenges tailored to their goals, such as applying for internships, managing budgets, or maintaining fitness routines. The app features progress tracking, community interaction, and gamification elements to enhance user engagement.

### How we built it
We built ChallengeMe using React Native for cross-platform mobile compatibility, enabling us to reach a wider audience. We utilized AWS Amplify for backend services, including authentication, data storage, and APIs, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

### Challenges we ran into
During the development process, we faced several challenges, including integrating AWS services, managing state in React Native, and ensuring smooth user experiences in the emulator. We also encountered hurdles in designing a user-friendly interface that effectively communicates progress and competition.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating an app that not only meets the needs of our target audience but also provides a unique and engaging experience.

### What we learned
Through this project, we learned the importance of collaboration and communication within our team. We also gained hands-on experience with React Native and AWS services, enhancing our technical skills and understanding of mobile app development.

### What's next for ChallengeMe
Looking ahead, we plan to enhance ChallengeMe by adding more features, such as personalized notifications, integration with social media platforms, and advanced analytics to help users track their progress. We also aim to expand our community features to facilitate greater interaction and support among users.
